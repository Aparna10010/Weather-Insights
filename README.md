**Weather Data Analysis Project**

_1. Project Overview_

This project focuses on analyzing weather data using Python. It explores trends, correlations, and insights from key weather variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, and more. The goal is to provide an understanding of the data through statistical analysis and interpretation.

_2. Features_

Cleaned and processed weather dataset.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Calculated correlations between weather variables.

Derived statistical insights like temperature distribution and wind speed trends.

Built correlation matrices between key variables.


_3. Technologies Used_

Python

Pandas (for data manipulation)

NumPy (for numerical operations)

Matplotlib/Seaborn (if youâ€™re using them for any visualizations)


Jupyter Notebook


_4. Dataset Information_

The dataset contains the following columns:

Date/Time: Timestamp of the recorded data.

Temp_C: Temperature in Celsius.

Dew Point Temp_C: Dew point temperature in Celsius.

Rel Hum_%: Relative Humidity in percentage.

Wind Speed_km/h: Wind speed in kilometers per hour.

Visibility_km: Visibility in kilometers.

Press_kPa: Atmospheric pressure in kilopascals.

Weather: Weather conditions as a categorical variable (e.g., clear, cloudy).


_5. Project Workflow_

**The workflow of the project is as follows:**

_1. Data Loading: Loaded the weather dataset._


_2. Data Cleaning:_

Handled missing values.

Removed duplicate entries.

Converted Date/Time to proper datetime format.



_3. Data Analysis:_

Calculated basic statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation.

Explored relationships between temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.



_4. Correlation Analysis_

Used the .corr() method to find correlations between numerical columns.


_5. Further Insights : _

Additional insights were derived from temperature trends and wind speed variations.


**Conclusion**

This project successfully analyzed key weather variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility. By cleaning the data and exploring correlations, we uncovered insights into weather patterns and relationships between variables. The analysis provides a strong foundation for further exploration, such as predictive modeling or expanding the dataset for more comprehensive insights. Future work could focus on integrating additional data and applying advanced methods for deeper analysis.
